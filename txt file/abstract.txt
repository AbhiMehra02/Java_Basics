abstract

Class:
    > Cannot be instantiated directly; it serves as a blueprint for other classes.
    > May contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and non-abstract (fully implemented) methods.
    > Designed to be extended by subclasses that provide implementations for abstract methods.
    > Example: abstract class Shape { ... }

Method:
    > Declared without an implementation (no method body).
    > Must be in an abstract class.
    > Any subclass extending the abstract class must override and implement the abstract method.
    > Example: abstract void draw();

Variable:
    > Not allowed in Java. Variables cannot be declared as abstract.
    > Variables in an abstract class can be final, static, or instance variables, but they cannot be abstract.
